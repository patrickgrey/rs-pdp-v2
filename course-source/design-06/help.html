          <h2 id="help1">What type of development objectives can be created?</h2>
          <p>There are different kinds of development plans staff can create, depending on the business and the unique needs of people. Development objectives could be growth-oriented, performance-oriented or relationship-oriented:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Performance- based plans - This plan is created in the context of performance conversations between manager and staff. The development objectives intend to improve or develop new skills required to accomplish performance objectives.</li>
            <li>Self-driven plans - Similar to the performance-based plan, this plan relies on staff self-evaluating and improving their performance regularly. Instead of management setting objectives for staff, people set their own objectives which feed into the broader team/unit objectives. It’s all about short-term objectives and being proactive rather than reactive.</li>
            <li>Succession planning plans - This plan focuses on longer-term planning and objectives. Staff is placed somewhere on the career path within the Agency and are working towards more responsibilities/senior role ( to be defined in future)</li>
            <li>Ad-hoc improvement plans - Similar to the succession plan, Ad-hoc improvement works when employees are assertive about their desires to learn more skills or take on more responsibility. The staff members and manager can act on it quickly instead of waiting around for the next performance review opportunity.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="help2">How do I ensure the development plan works?</h2>

          <p>It’s important that development plans are not separated from daily work lives, as something to be done in the ‘free time.’

Check-in regularly: Its important that the plan works as a continuous working document - and not existing at a fixed point in time. Codifying the plan and referring back to it helps establish its importance.</p>

          <h2 id="help3">How do I define effective development actions?</h2>

          <p>Once the alignment has been established and the areas for development identified, the path to this development needs to be mapped out. Don’t forget the 70/20/10 rule – that 70% of learning comes from on-the-job experience, 20% from other people (coaching, peers, mentors, etc.) and 10% from coursework and training.</p>

          <p>You might build formal training into the development plan but most steps should be crafted into the job itself or based on relationships with others.</p>

          <h2 id="help4">How can I collect insights and review progress throughout the development plan?</h2>

          <p>It’s important that self-adjustment and reflection are built into the plan so that manager, supervisors, coaches and staff can see what went well, what didn’t and make changes so that, over time, the development becomes more successful and smoother. The plan includes dedicated sections to collect both feedback from manager, supervisors, coaches (etc.) and document personal insights.</p>

          <h2 id="help5">Who can view or edit this PDP?</h2>
          <p>You and your line manager can view and edit your PDP. If you have added them, your mentor or coach can also view and edit it. Finally, a small number of HRS staff can view and edit it: this is to provide support as and when required.</p>

          <p>HRS staff will also get statistical information on the use of the tool (how many people used it, how many objectives were created, in what competency area), but this will not include your personal data.</p>
